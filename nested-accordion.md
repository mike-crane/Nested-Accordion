  How do you interact with them?

    By clicking each heading, it triggers each section to expand or drop down to reveal the content and submenus. The submenus contain the same interactive element with the same effect.

  What visual effects are produced by interacting?

    The bullet logos beside each heading change from gray to blue and rotate when hovered over and rotate further when clicked. The page also expands down further revealing content when the headings are clicked as well as contracts back up, removing the content.
